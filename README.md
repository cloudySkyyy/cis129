## Project 1: Software Sales
A software company sells a package that retails for $99. Quantity discounts are given according to the following table:<br>

|Quantity|Discount|
|-|-|
|10-19|20%|
|20-49|30%|
|50-99|40%|
|100+|50%|

Design a program that asks the user to enter the number of packages purchased.<br>
The program should then display the amount of the discount (if any) and the total amount of the purchase after the discount.
